# Van-Arsdel-sales-performance

# The Problem
In the project, the goal was to analyze the sales performance of a fictitious company, Van Arsdel, in the retail market. The dataset contained information on sales, geographic distribution and competitors, and the main challenge was to structure an effective analysis for the Chief Marketing Officer, allowing him to make strategic decisions based on the data.

# The Solution
To address the problem, I followed an end-to-end approach using Power BI:

Data Collection and Cleaning: I imported data from CSV files, Excel and folders, using Power Query to unify the sources and normalize the data.

Data Modeling: I created a star model, establishing one-to-many relationships between the transactional sales table and the geographic, product and manufacturer dimensions.

DAX Measures: I developed advanced metrics such as revenue growth vs. previous year and market share of each competitor, using DAX expressions to make the reporting dynamic and interactive.

Data Visualization: I built intuitive dashboards that allow the user to explore sales over time, by geography and by manufacturer, with interactive drill-downs and key performance indicators.

# The impact
The result was an interactive and scalable reporting system, capable of providing immediate insights into sales and market share. Thanks to this project, I consolidated my ability to transform raw data into strategic information, improving skills in Power BI, data modeling and advanced analysis with DAX.
